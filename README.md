# Benchmarking Architectures

This project encompasses various components aimed at benchmarking three different microcontroller architectures all RISC based. It was a project for Microlab,z National Technical University of Athens.

## Project Components

## Project Components

### 1. **STM**:
   Benchmarking STM microcontrollers.
   
### 2. **RISCV maixduino sipeed**:
   Benchmarking RISC-V microcontrollers, specifically the Maixduino board by Sipeed.
   
### 3. **AVR 328pb**:
   Benchmarking AVR microcontrollers, specifically the ATmega328pb.

## Methodology

In this project, we utilized two simple algorithms:

1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**:
   - Measure memory speed i/o.

2. **Convolution**:
   - Measure both computational speed and operations efficiency, using different data types such as integers, floats, and doubles.
